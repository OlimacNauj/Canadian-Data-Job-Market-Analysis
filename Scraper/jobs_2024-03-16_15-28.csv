Most of us have more tasks on our to-do lists than there are hours in the day.

It’s pretty clear we can’t do it all. But what can we do?

By prioritizing well, we can achieve our most important goals without putting in unsustainable work hours. We always look for the low-hanging fruit, or the first domino piece to topple.

Additionally, experience has shown that it’s usually faster to do something right straight away.

So instead of applying another quick fix, we always try to get to the bottom of the problem and create a systematic solution that will also prevent other similar issues in the future.

While this may take a little longer, ultimately it helps us Do Less, Achieve More.

Value #2

Follow Data, Not Opinions

The 20th-century economy was built on oil as the most important raw material.

The 21st-century economy is being built on data as the most important raw material.

With the rise of artificial intelligence, it’s becoming clear that the companies with the best data will have a massive advantage.

That’s why we’re building a data-driven company at its core.

We start by collecting large amounts of data wherever possible. This includes not only data about our user actions (stored with respect to privacy), but also many other types of data.

For example, we track how long projects take to complete so we can create more accurate estimates and make informed decisions for how to organize our work.

Without relevant data, all we’re left with are our opinions. We prefer the data.

Value #3

Ship What You Start

With so much important work to do, it’s easy to start yet another project...

But have you shipped the project you started last month?

This value discourages our team from tackling too many priorities at the same time.

It’s definitely not fun to manage a large number of projects without seeing the finish line.

It’s not only frustrating but also inefficient as you keep losing time to regular context switching.

As a company, we pay a cost every time someone starts working on a new project. But we only get that cost back when the final deliverables of the project are shipped to the end-users.

So everyone benefits when you Ship What You Start.

To show us that you read this page, please use the password ship at the top of your first application response on the next page.

We’ll reject applications without the password.

Value #4

Fight For Our Standards

At iPhone Photography School, we strive for excellence in everything we do.

But excellence isn’t a destination. You can’t get there as the goalpost keeps moving.

So we look at excellence as continuously getting better at the work that we do.

And that’s why our Fight For Our Standards value is so important.

First and foremost, it’s a reminder for us to always deliver our absolute best work.

It’s a reminder to expect the best from yourself, as well as from your coworkers, at all times.

It’s also an invitation for everyone to put their honest thoughts and feedback on the table, no matter how uncomfortable they might feel at times.

We believe this approach is necessary to consistently produce high-quality results.

That’s why we choose to Fight For Our Standards.

Value #5

Make It Beautiful

As a visual arts company, we live and breathe beautiful things.

We love beautiful photos, beautiful videos, beautiful designs, even beautiful spreadsheets!

Put simply, we try to make our work as beautiful as we can...

And this passion goes beyond what most people would consider rational.

So why do we do it?

Well, quite simply, we believe that beauty matters.

It matters to us. It matters to our customers. And we hope it also matters to you.

Beauty

meets data.

Creatives

meet geeks.

Apply here if you are an exceptional Go, Rust, or C/C++ software engineer and want to work on next-generation open source VMM or container technology, or related open source networking and storage.

Container, virtualisation and cloud infrastructure have become essentials of modern software deployments. We invest in open source related to application isolation, workload orchestration, system or OCI containers, micro service architecture or cloud infrastructure.

Here are some examples of projects under way at Canonical.

RustVMM has great potential as a new hypervisor for Linux. We are building a team to work on this, with an emphasis on performance, security and operability. Work in Rust and bring your expert knowledge of VMM and related kernel networking and storage capabilities.

Docker images are easy to make and publish on Docker Hub and other registries, but the quality, consistency and security maintenance of those images is broadly very poor. Canonical is in a good position to publish a portfolio of outstanding Docker images. Our Rockcraft team is designing and implementing an elevated Docker image experience for the open source community.

LXD is a modern system container and virtual machine manager that is widely used on Ubuntu, ChromeOS and other Linux platforms. LXD engineering spans the entire software stack from low-level kernel work on namespaces, confinement, security, filesystems, VMMs and networking, to the high level management REST API and CLI.

Members of the Kubernetes product team build MicroK8s for on-rails K8s, and Charmed Kubernetes for more sophisticated integration. We work on K8s itself and on the operations tooling around it.

The OpenStack team deliver Charmed OpenStack, OVN / OVS and Ceph. This work brings cloud platform technologies to large-scale computing environments.

These teams hire system level C/C++, Golang, Rust and Python developers to work on security-critical, performance-critical and mission-critical code, focused on software delivery, containers, security, sandboxing, application orchestration and management. Our teams are motivated to have a meaningful impact on modern cloud computing technologies.

Location: we have remote container and virt engineering roles in every time zone.
What you will focus on
• Design and specify new features, building consensus on approach
• Engage with upstream communities in your area of expertise
• Conduct security analysis and reviews to ensure defence in depth
• Create and monitor performance benchmarks to optimise your product
• Collaborate proactively with a distributed team
• Write high quality code to create new features
• Debug issues and produce high quality code to fix them
• Review code produced by other engineers
• Discuss ideas and collaborate on finding good solutions
What we are looking for in you
• An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
• Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path
• Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations
• You have worked on open source virt or container tech
• You have experience working in the kernel or very low level system
• Professional written and spoken English
• Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred)
• Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability
• Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation
• Excellent communication and presentation skills
• Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments
• Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each
Additional skills we value
• Performance engineering and security experience
What we offer you

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.

230,Back-end Developer (PHP+Laravel),IPhone Photography School,"Do You Want To Join This Revolutionary Photography Education Company?

What’s iPhone Photography

School all about?

We make online courses that help people take stunning photos with the iPhone.

With our 9-year track record, we’re the world’s leader in mobile photography education.

And while we’re proud of everything we’ve accomplished so far, we’re just getting started...

Our team has set some incredibly ambitious goals (read on to find out what they are).

So right now, we're looking for remote team members to help us meet our goals.

But would we make a good fit for each other?

Read on to find out...

OUR MISSION

We’ll get Apple to put our app

on every iPhone by 2025

There are currently one billion active iPhone devices in the world.

Our mission is to create such an excellent learning experience that Apple will happily put it on every iPhone in the world by 2025, knowing that they could never do it better themselves.

We understand that this is an unusual and highly ambitious goal. But we really mean it.

Thankfully, we have good reasons to believe that it can in fact be achieved.

Please understand that this isn’t yet another aspirational goal that will soon be forgotten.

Our mission requires everyone on our team to consistently deliver their absolute best work, day after day, at a quality level that would satisfy Apple.

That’s the only way we can get there.

Please only apply if you’re ready to do whatever it takes to achieve our mission.

We’ll get Apple to put our app

on every iPhone by 2025.

Our Values

Our values are simple guidelines for how we’ve chosen to do our work.

They serve as concise reminders for how we make various day-to-day decisions.

Please note that no company’s values are universally accepted. We’ve chosen our values according to what’s important to us.

You may like our values, or you may hate them.

Please review our values carefully and only apply if this is how you want to work.

Value #1

Do Less, Achieve More

Most of us have more tasks on our to-do lists than there are hours in the day.

It’s pretty clear we can’t do it all. But what can we do?

By prioritizing well, we can achieve our most important goals without putting in unsustainable work hours. We always look for the low-hanging fruit, or the first domino piece to topple.

Additionally, experience has shown that it’s usually faster to do something right straight away.

So instead of applying another quick fix, we always try to get to the bottom of the problem and create a systematic solution that will also prevent other similar issues in the future.

While this may take a little longer, ultimately it helps us Do Less, Achieve More.

Value #2

Follow Data, Not Opinions

The 20th-century economy was built on oil as the most important raw material.

The 21st-century economy is being built on data as the most important raw material.

With the rise of artificial intelligence, it’s becoming clear that the companies with the best data will have a massive advantage.

That’s why we’re building a data-driven company at its core.

We start by collecting large amounts of data wherever possible. This includes not only data about our user actions (stored with respect to privacy), but also many other types of data.

For example, we track how long projects take to complete so we can create more accurate estimates and make informed decisions for how to organize our work.

Without relevant data, all we’re left with are our opinions. We prefer the data.

Value #3

Ship What You Start

With so much important work to do, it’s easy to start yet another project...

But have you shipped the project you started last month?

This value discourages our team from tackling too many priorities at the same time.

It’s definitely not fun to manage a large number of projects without seeing the finish line.

It’s not only frustrating but also inefficient as you keep losing time to regular context switching.

As a company, we pay a cost every time someone starts working on a new project. But we only get that cost back when the final deliverables of the project are shipped to the end-users.

So everyone benefits when you Ship What You Start.

To show us that you read this page, please use the password ship at the top of your first application response on the next page.

We’ll reject applications without the password.

Value #4

Fight For Our Standards

At iPhone Photography School, we strive for excellence in everything we do.

But excellence isn’t a destination. You can’t get there as the goalpost keeps moving.

So we look at excellence as continuously getting better at the work that we do.

And that’s why our Fight For Our Standards value is so important.

First and foremost, it’s a reminder for us to always deliver our absolute best work.

It’s a reminder to expect the best from yourself, as well as from your coworkers, at all times.

It’s also an invitation for everyone to put their honest thoughts and feedback on the table, no matter how uncomfortable they might feel at times.

We believe this approach is necessary to consistently produce high-quality results.

That’s why we choose to Fight For Our Standards.

Value #5

Make It Beautiful

As a visual arts company, we live and breathe beautiful things.

We love beautiful photos, beautiful videos, beautiful designs, even beautiful spreadsheets!

Put simply, we try to make our work as beautiful as we can...

And this passion goes beyond what most people would consider rational.

So why do we do it?

Well, quite simply, we believe that beauty matters.

It matters to us. It matters to our customers. And we hope it also matters to you.

Beauty

meets data.

Creatives

meet geeks.

Join our international team of 30+ remote A-players.

233,Senior PHP Developer - Backend (Remote),Rivalry,"Description Rivalry has been pushing the boundaries on what an esports betting product can be, and we’ve been doing it well. As our user base grows and we enter new global regions, the demand to create new and better products is increasing. We're focused on having the best product in the gambling space. We aren’t willing to accept being marginally better.

We are working hard to create something leaps and bounds above anything else out there. We are investing heavily into our product development team and are looking to hire a Backend Developer to join us on this journey.

Does that sound fun? Keep reading!

The Role This is a senior role working alongside the current backend software engineering team; however, you will also work alongside both experienced and junior frontend developers, as well as, various other disciplines in order to share and learn from one another as well as lead projects yourself.

This role is one part planning tasks and knowledge sharing with the team, one part solo coding work, and one part team resource where people can lean on you for support.

We pride ourselves on keeping up with a modern stack, focusing both on web performance and developer quality of life. We work where we get our best work done. Be it in our Toronto office, remote or a hybrid of both. We're still a team that Pair Programs often, holds regular standups and plays games together regularly. We are a rapidly changing organization and are always open to discuss what we're focusing on and how we're getting there. We expect that you'll be a part of our feature planning, as well as helping vet our implementation options.

You will also be a part of
• Leading a small team with a singular focus for the sprint, where you can report back to the CTO and Lead
• Brainstorming sessions where you will contribute ideas to future features
• Sprint Planning, where you will break down large epics into smaller actionable tasks with details
• Code Reviews, providing feedback and direction to others
• Pair Programming over Tuple, providing support to team members
• Prototyping concepts as a part of idea exploration

Skills, knowledge and expertise Our challenges involve consuming disparate data sources and transforming the data into usable normalized data sets to be actioned within our application. For instance, we have many sources of data for matches and odds. We need to take these data sources and transform them into a normalized set of matches and data. Each provider has its own scheme for organizing data. Additionally, we are always looking to optimize the real-time notifications of odds to users through web sockets and push notifications. Our core platform has a lot of the same challenges that a forex or stock trading system would have.

On a more technical level, your job will be to architect, develop and maintain our backend application code. Experience with high concurrency systems, load balanced applications, role-based access control systems, geographic and data residency patterns, clean tested code, performance optimization and instrumentation are very important for success in this role. You should have a strong understanding (4 or more years experience) of one or more of the following:
• Relevant experience as an engineer with a good understanding of backend technologies
• Proven development background in the following: PHP, NodeJS, Rails
• Extensive knowledge of some or all of the following: Docker / Containerization, Kubernetes, Security Design, Queuing, Automated testing, Data pipelines
• You feel comfortable diving into existing code and interacting with developers at all levels of seniority
• Proven track record of shipping products in an iterative manner
• A commitment and drive for quality, technical excellence and result

Our stack is a makeup of
• Laravel (backend API)
• NodeJS (microservices and frontend)
• VueJS (frontend)
• Websockets (Extensive use of pusher)

Why work here
• We offer a competitive salary and total rewards package including a comprehensive benefits package and stock options (we believe it's important for everyone on our team to own a piece of the company and share in our success).
• A chance to work in one of the most exciting and rapidly growing industries.
• Work with an extremely talented team who share a love for video games and esports on truly innovative projects; we’re not your typical online gambling site - we’re a tech company first, and a gambling company second.
• Work where you get your best work done. Whether that’s in an office (when it’s safe enough) or in the comfort of your own home. Our offices are located in Toronto, but a large portion of our company works remotely across 17 different countries.
• Free video games! Every Rivalry employee gets a monthly stipend","Winnipeg, MB",895a_tbZB0aNxmX2AAAAAA%3D%3D,Full-time,,ZipRecruiter,null

244,Back-end Developer (PHP+Laravel),IPhone Photography School,"Do You Want To Join This Revolutionary Photography Education Company?

What’s iPhone Photography

School all about?

We make online courses that help people take stunning photos with the iPhone.

With our 9-year track record, we’re the world’s leader in mobile photography education.

And while we’re proud of everything we’ve accomplished so far, we’re just getting started...

Our team has set some incredibly ambitious goals (read on to find out what they are).

So right now, we're looking for remote team members to help us meet our goals.

But would we make a good fit for each other?

Read on to find out...

OUR MISSION

We’ll get Apple to put our app

on every iPhone by 2025

There are currently one billion active iPhone devices in the world.

Our mission is to create such an excellent learning experience that Apple will happily put it on every iPhone in the world by 2025, knowing that they could never do it better themselves.

We understand that this is an unusual and highly ambitious goal. But we really mean it.

Thankfully, we have good reasons to believe that it can in fact be achieved.

Please understand that this isn’t yet another aspirational goal that will soon be forgotten.

Our mission requires everyone on our team to consistently deliver their absolute best work, day after day, at a quality level that would satisfy Apple.

That’s the only way we can get there.

Please only apply if you’re ready to do whatever it takes to achieve our mission.

We’ll get Apple to put our app

on every iPhone by 2025.

Our Values

Our values are simple guidelines for how we’ve chosen to do our work.

They serve as concise reminders for how we make various day-to-day decisions.

Please note that no company’s values are universally accepted. We’ve chosen our values according to what’s important to us.

You may like our values, or you may hate them.

Please review our values carefully and only apply if this is how you want to work.

Value #1

Do Less, Achieve More

Most of us have more tasks on our to-do lists than there are hours in the day.

It’s pretty clear we can’t do it all. But what can we do?

By prioritizing well, we can achieve our most important goals without putting in unsustainable work hours. We always look for the low-hanging fruit, or the first domino piece to topple.

Additionally, experience has shown that it’s usually faster to do something right straight away.

So instead of applying another quick fix, we always try to get to the bottom of the problem and create a systematic solution that will also prevent other similar issues in the future.

While this may take a little longer, ultimately it helps us Do Less, Achieve More.

Value #2

Follow Data, Not Opinions

The 20th-century economy was built on oil as the most important raw material.

The 21st-century economy is being built on data as the most important raw material.

With the rise of artificial intelligence, it’s becoming clear that the companies with the best data will have a massive advantage.

That’s why we’re building a data-driven company at its core.

We start by collecting large amounts of data wherever possible. This includes not only data about our user actions (stored with respect to privacy), but also many other types of data.

For example, we track how long projects take to complete so we can create more accurate estimates and make informed decisions for how to organize our work.

Without relevant data, all we’re left with are our opinions. We prefer the data.

Value #3

Ship What You Start

With so much important work to do, it’s easy to start yet another project...

But have you shipped the project you started last month?

This value discourages our team from tackling too many priorities at the same time.

It’s definitely not fun to manage a large number of projects without seeing the finish line.

It’s not only frustrating but also inefficient as you keep losing time to regular context switching.

As a company, we pay a cost every time someone starts working on a new project. But we only get that cost back when the final deliverables of the project are shipped to the end-users.

So everyone benefits when you Ship What You Start.

To show us that you read this page, please use the password ship at the top of your first application response on the next page.

We’ll reject applications without the password.

Value #4

Fight For Our Standards

At iPhone Photography School, we strive for excellence in everything we do.

But excellence isn’t a destination. You can’t get there as the goalpost keeps moving.

So we look at excellence as continuously getting better at the work that we do.

And that’s why our Fight For Our Standards value is so important.

First and foremost, it’s a reminder for us to always deliver our absolute best work.

It’s a reminder to expect the best from yourself, as well as from your coworkers, at all times.

It’s also an invitation for everyone to put their honest thoughts and feedback on the table, no matter how uncomfortable they might feel at times.

We believe this approach is necessary to consistently produce high-quality results.

That’s why we choose to Fight For Our Standards.

Value #5

Make It Beautiful

As a visual arts company, we live and breathe beautiful things.

We love beautiful photos, beautiful videos, beautiful designs, even beautiful spreadsheets!

Put simply, we try to make our work as beautiful as we can...

And this passion goes beyond what most people would consider rational.

So why do we do it?

Well, quite simply, we believe that beauty matters.

It matters to us. It matters to our customers. And we hope it also matters to you.

Beauty

meets data.

Creatives

meet geeks.

We aren't willing to accept being marginally better.

We are working hard to create something leaps and bounds above anything else out there. We are investing heavily into our product development team and are looking to hire a Backend Developer to join us on this journey.

Does that sound fun? Keep reading!

The Role This is a senior role working alongside the current backend software engineering team; however, you will also work alongside both experienced and junior frontend developers, as well as, various other disciplines in order to share and learn from one another as well as lead projects yourself.

This role is one part planning tasks and knowledge sharing with the team, one part solo coding work, and one part team resource where people can lean on you for support.

We pride ourselves on keeping up with a modern stack, focusing both on web performance and developer quality of life. We work where we get our best work done. Be it in our Toronto office, remote or a hybrid of both. We're still a team that Pair Programs often, holds regular standups and plays games together regularly. We are a rapidly changing organization and are always open to discuss what we're focusing on and how we're getting there. We expect that you'll be a part of our feature planning, as well as helping vet our implementation options.

Skills, knowledge and expertise Our challenges involve consuming disparate data sources and transforming the data into usable normalized data sets to be actioned within our application.

Each provider has its own scheme for organizing data. Additionally, we are always looking to optimize the real-time notifications of odds to users through web sockets and push notifications. Our core platform has a lot of the same challenges that a forex or stock trading system would have.

On a more technical level, your job will be to architect, develop and maintain our backend application code. Experience with high concurrency systems, load balanced applications, role-based access control systems, geographic and data residency patterns, clean tested code, performance optimization and instrumentation are very important for success in this role.

• A chance to work in one of the most exciting and rapidly growing industries.
• Work with an extremely talented team who share a love for video games and esports on truly innovative projects; we're not your typical online gambling site - we're a tech company first, and a gambling company second.
• Work where you get your best work done. Whether that's in an office (when it's safe enough) or in the comfort of your own home. Our offices are located in Toronto, but a large portion of our company works remotely across 17 different countries.

281,Back-end Developer (PHP+Laravel),IPhone Photography School,"Do You Want To Join This Revolutionary Photography Education Company?

What’s iPhone Photography

School all about?

We make online courses that help people take stunning photos with the iPhone.

With our 9-year track record, we’re the world’s leader in mobile photography education.

And while we’re proud of everything we’ve accomplished so far, we’re just getting started...

Our team has set some incredibly ambitious goals (read on to find out what they are).

So right now, we're looking for remote team members to help us meet our goals.

But would we make a good fit for each other?

Read on to find out...

OUR MISSION

We’ll get Apple to put our app

on every iPhone by 2025

There are currently one billion active iPhone devices in the world.

Our mission is to create such an excellent learning experience that Apple will happily put it on every iPhone in the world by 2025, knowing that they could never do it better themselves.

We understand that this is an unusual and highly ambitious goal. But we really mean it.

Thankfully, we have good reasons to believe that it can in fact be achieved.

Please understand that this isn’t yet another aspirational goal that will soon be forgotten.

Our mission requires everyone on our team to consistently deliver their absolute best work, day after day, at a quality level that would satisfy Apple.

That’s the only way we can get there.

Please only apply if you’re ready to do whatever it takes to achieve our mission.

We’ll get Apple to put our app

on every iPhone by 2025.

Our Values

Our values are simple guidelines for how we’ve chosen to do our work.

They serve as concise reminders for how we make various day-to-day decisions.

Please note that no company’s values are universally accepted. We’ve chosen our values according to what’s important to us.

You may like our values, or you may hate them.

Please review our values carefully and only apply if this is how you want to work.

Value #1

Do Less, Achieve More

Most of us have more tasks on our to-do lists than there are hours in the day.

It’s pretty clear we can’t do it all. But what can we do?

By prioritizing well, we can achieve our most important goals without putting in unsustainable work hours. We always look for the low-hanging fruit, or the first domino piece to topple.

Additionally, experience has shown that it’s usually faster to do something right straight away.

So instead of applying another quick fix, we always try to get to the bottom of the problem and create a systematic solution that will also prevent other similar issues in the future.

While this may take a little longer, ultimately it helps us Do Less, Achieve More.

Value #2

Follow Data, Not Opinions

The 20th-century economy was built on oil as the most important raw material.

The 21st-century economy is being built on data as the most important raw material.

With the rise of artificial intelligence, it’s becoming clear that the companies with the best data will have a massive advantage.

That’s why we’re building a data-driven company at its core.

We start by collecting large amounts of data wherever possible. This includes not only data about our user actions (stored with respect to privacy), but also many other types of data.

For example, we track how long projects take to complete so we can create more accurate estimates and make informed decisions for how to organize our work.

Without relevant data, all we’re left with are our opinions. We prefer the data.

Value #3

Ship What You Start

With so much important work to do, it’s easy to start yet another project...

But have you shipped the project you started last month?

This value discourages our team from tackling too many priorities at the same time.

It’s definitely not fun to manage a large number of projects without seeing the finish line.

It’s not only frustrating but also inefficient as you keep losing time to regular context switching.

As a company, we pay a cost every time someone starts working on a new project. But we only get that cost back when the final deliverables of the project are shipped to the end-users.

So everyone benefits when you Ship What You Start.

To show us that you read this page, please use the password ship at the top of your first application response on the next page.

We’ll reject applications without the password.

Value #4

Fight For Our Standards

At iPhone Photography School, we strive for excellence in everything we do.

But excellence isn’t a destination. You can’t get there as the goalpost keeps moving.

So we look at excellence as continuously getting better at the work that we do.

And that’s why our Fight For Our Standards value is so important.

First and foremost, it’s a reminder for us to always deliver our absolute best work.

It’s a reminder to expect the best from yourself, as well as from your coworkers, at all times.

It’s also an invitation for everyone to put their honest thoughts and feedback on the table, no matter how uncomfortable they might feel at times.

We believe this approach is necessary to consistently produce high-quality results.

That’s why we choose to Fight For Our Standards.

Value #5

Make It Beautiful

As a visual arts company, we live and breathe beautiful things.

We love beautiful photos, beautiful videos, beautiful designs, even beautiful spreadsheets!

Put simply, we try to make our work as beautiful as we can...

And this passion goes beyond what most people would consider rational.

So why do we do it?

Well, quite simply, we believe that beauty matters.

It matters to us. It matters to our customers. And we hope it also matters to you.

Beauty

meets data.

Creatives

meet geeks.

Join our international team of 30+ remote A-players.
