• Data Analysis: Help clients manage their data better and feel confident that the information generated from their business data is reliable and can help them make the right business decisions.
• Acquire Data: Work with clients to understand and set up and optimize the process to acquire comprehensive datasets used as the foundation of PwC's audits. This includes implementing the cutting edge technology (such as PwC Extract) for data extraction and transformation to facilitate end to end automation.

With connectivity being a key enabler of our strategy, our objective is to become the most connected firm - connected to our clients, our communities and to each other.
