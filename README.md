## Canadian Data Job Market Analysis
### Overview
This project analyzes the job market trends in Canada, focusing specifically on data-related jobs. The dataset consists of job postings scraped from various sources over multiple dates in 2024. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the analysis aims to uncover insights into the most in-demand jobs, required skills, job types, and salary distributions across different Canadian cities.

### Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insightful visualizations including word clouds, job type distributions, and demand analysis across various Canadian cities.
NLP Techniques: Regular expressions and Named Entity Recognition (NER) models are used to extract and clean salary data from job descriptions.
Clustering Analysis: K-means clustering groups similar job types based on skills and requirements.
Salary Prediction: Machine learning models, including linear regression and random forest, are used to predict salaries based on job postings.
### Technologies Used
* Python: For data analysis, manipulation, and machine learning.
* Pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation.
* Scikit-learn: For clustering (K-means) and predictive modeling (linear regression, random forest).
* NLTK: For natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as stopword removal and tokenization.
* Transformers: For Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract salary information.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizations of job trends, salaries, and skill distributions.
